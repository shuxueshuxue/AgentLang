An **agent programming language** will feature:
- LLM call caching (want live coding?)
- Side-effect modeling and environment management (e.g. file system operation)
- Visual monitoring, intervention
- Dynamic performance tracing, prompt auto-optimization
- Abstraction, efficiency: pattern-reuse, optimization for speed (e.g. auto-async execution)
- (optional) Output schema auto-inference and many magic features like this
- (optional) Native agent protocols support (MCP)

We don't focus on "tool-use" or "agent communication protocols". They are intuitive but brittle. Terrible for programmatic control.
